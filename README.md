### scraping
A collection of scripts that I write to scrape data from websites.

Prerequisites*:  
`python`   
`jupyter`  
`beautifulsoup4`  


1. `yocket`:  Extract top(n) Universities from Yocket, where n=25 / 26-50 / 51-100, and major is Computer Science.
 (You can change the URLs according to your major and the script should work fine)
